# VecDyn
The Global **Vec**tor Population **Dyn**amics Database

## Instructions
* The database template file, its field descriptions, and a minimal example file are located in the `Template` directory. 
Notice that all files are in plain text csv format, and not in Excel format or similar. 
This facilitates text parsing by scripts, prevents data loss/corruption, and allows for detailed comparisons of 
changes via version control systems.

#
* The `GPDD` directory contains the documentation of the 
[**G**lobal **P**opulation **D**ynamics **D**atabase](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/cpb/databases/gpdd), a 
pre-existing database of population dynamics, hosted in Silwood Park, Imperial College London since 1999. 
VecDyn aims to learn from both GPDD's success and potential shortcomings as it moves forward.

#
* Any suggestions or todos with regards to the database (e.g., new columns, schema modifications etc.) can be 
logged as [Issues on GitHub](https://github.com/vectorbite/VecDyn/issues). Issues allow for discussions 
among multiple users, file attachments, colour-coded labels etc.
